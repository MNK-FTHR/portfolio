    text: `
        My name is Victor GRANIER, a web developer familiar with multiple languages and frameworks, a big fan of new technologies, and always staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends.

        Most of my experience has been on the front-end side of the projects I've had the chance to work on, but I have also gained experience in handling complex back-end systems on a few occasions, as well as databases.

        Additionally, I enjoy project architecture. I apply my knowledge to school or personal projects, and I would be happy to provide my perspective if needed, as I consistently keep myself informed on best practices and new approaches, which of course evolve as technology advances in the development field.

        My skills have allowed me to work under different contracts in a small startup, a mid-sized company, and a large corporation. I enjoyed each of these experiences, so I don't have a preference for a specific type of work environment.

        I have also had the opportunity to work both independently and as part of a team. While I enjoyed both, I prefer working in teams as I tend to communicate well with my colleagues, helping to keep the project moving forward.

        I am looking for a web developer position, I have no preferences regarding the type of project or the language used.

        I would like to contribute my skills to companies or individuals who need a developer capable of creating or working on a project, either alone or in a team.

        As you can see in my skills section, I am ready to work with all types of modern and popular technologies, as well as older projects.
